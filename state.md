## Goal for the Morning: "Simple" State 

- review basic event listener and callback function management
- setup state where we track clicks in state(integer): hugging a teddybear 
- track booleans in state: hide/show a friendly chinchilla 
- DRY up code / separate concerns / examine props with state by making multiple components 

#### By the end of this exercise, we will have reviewed most of the material in State of Chocolate. 

## Goal for Afternoon: State with .map 

- review react with .map
- tracking a dog that we have clicked 
- adding logic to highlight or not highlight a dog 
- adding a callback function that correctly updates the selected dog 


#### By the end of this facilitation, we will be comfortable with concepts and implementation for the system check
